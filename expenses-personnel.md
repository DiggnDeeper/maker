<li><b>Financial Controller:</b> Head bookkeeper and accountant for the business. We hired someone for this position before we hired anyone else, because income, expenses, and filing taxes is such an existence-threatening big deal that we needed to pay someone for this immediately.</li>
<li><b>CEO/Executive Director:</b> Primary point of contact and main organizer for the early life of the organization, head manager for the later life of the organization.</li>
<li><b>Facilities Manager:</b> Responsible for repair and maintenance of shop spaces and tools. You need someone like this sooner rather than later; managers and organizers donâ€™t have the time to be elbows-deep in broken machines for long periods.</li>
<li><b>Member Services:</b> Answers phone calls, emails, and any in-person complaints, and makes sure the business runs smoothly.</li>
<li><b>Development:</b> Seek grants and partnerships with other organizations. A good development lead pays for themselves several times over, especially in a nonprofit setting.</li>
<li><b>Programs:</b> Develops classes and programs as a source of income.</li>
<li><b>Marketing:</b> Markets the business and its programs to the public.</li>
<li><b>Full-Time Trainer:</b> Trains and tests new members on equipment.</li>
</ul>
